Color mixing application in visual C#
The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot 
        be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary 
        color, as shown here:
            When you mix red and blue, you get purple.
            When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.
            When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
        Create an application that lets the user select two primary colors from two 
        different sets of Radio buttons. The form should also have a Mix button. When the 
        user clicks the Mix button, the formâ€™s background should change to the color that you 
        get when you mix the two selected primary colors.
